<ol><li><h3>Stream Sentiments<h3></li><ul><li>First, check out my sentiment analysis project called "Stream Sentiments" (<a href="">here</a>). It's a website that reads in live comments from streams on twitch.tv, and runs them through a sentiment classifier hosted on Google Cloud Platform. It then creates charts and generates summary statistics on the calculated sentiments.</li><li>For details as to how I trained the underlying neural network, see the (<a href="https://github.com/vaheg55/DataScienceProjects/blob/main/train.ipynb">notebook</a>).</li></ul><li><h3>80 - 20 Rule Analysis</h3></li><ul><li>Next, look at my scrutiny of the famous "80 - 20" rule (<a href="https://github.com/vaheg55/DataScienceProjects/blob/main/80-20%20rule%20analysis.ipynb">here</a>), where I pull YouTube views data from the YouTube API and examine whether the top 20 percent of videos from each content creator do in fact account for more than 80% of views.</li></ul><li><h3>Most Expensive LEGO Theme</h3></li><ul><li>Lastly, I would like you to check out a webscraping project (<a href="https://github.com/vaheg55/DataScienceProjects/blob/main/Most%20Expensive%20Lego%20Theme.ipynb">here</a>) where I use selenium to pull products data from lego.com, and settle the question of what the most expensive LEGO theme is.</li></ul></ol>
