<ol><li>First, check out my sentiment analysis project called "Stream Sentiments" (<a href="">here</a>). It's a website that reads in live comments from streams on Twitch.tv, and runs them through a sentiment classifier hosted on Google Cloud Platform. For details as to how I trained the underlying neural network, see the notebook (<a href="https://github.com/vaheg55/DataScienceProjects/blob/main/train.ipynb">notebook</a>)</li></ol>
